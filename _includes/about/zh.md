### Sebastian Sonne

Hey there! I'm **Sebastian**, currently a foreign exchange student soaking up life at Magnolia West High School in **Texas**. When I'm not hitting the books, you'll find me diving into the world of tech, experimenting with **JAVA** and **MySQL** to whip up practical applications.

Beyond the digital realm, I'm all about chasing **tennis** balls on the courtâ€”it's my game. Hiking is another love of mine; there's something magical about nature that keeps me grounded. And, oh, did I mention I'm into freezing moments in time through photography? Check out my works on **[Instagram](www.instagram.com/sebastian._.sonne)**!

Let's connect and share the journey, whether it's coding adventures, acing a serve, or capturing the beauty of the world one photo at a time.
