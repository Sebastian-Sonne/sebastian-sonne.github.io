### Sebastian Sonne

Hey there,

I'm __Sebastian Sonne__, currently weaving my story as an exchange student at Magnolia West High School in Magnolia, Texas. But let me take you back a bit—I started my adventure in the heart of Germany, and then embarked on a thrilling 3 1/2-year stint in the mesmerizing skyline of [Singapore](https://google.com/search?q=singapore), where ginormous skyscrapers painted the cityscape.

##### **A Global Explorer with a Camera, a Tennis Racket, and a Heart for Connections**

I'm not your typical __exchange student__; I'm the guy with a camera always at the ready. Whether it's capturing the [neon lights reflecting](https://www.google.com/search?q=singapore+neon+night) off Singapore's architectural wonders or the Texan sunsets casting their warm glow, I document it all. No surprises here—I've got a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/sebastianSonne) where I share my travel escapades. No psychic abilities required.

But it's not just about the places; it's about the people. I thrive on being surrounded by friends, and my journey has taken me to many corners of the globe. From the expansive landscapes of Australia to the vibrant culture of Japan, and the eclectic charm of Southeast Asia, I've soaked in the richness of diverse cultures. In Europe, I've woven through various countries, and in the Southern USA, I've discovered a whole new rhythm of life.

##### **Tennis Enthusiast, Code Weaver, and DevOps Explorer**

When I'm not behind the lens, I'm on the tennis court, navigating the line between passion and sweat. Off the court, I'm diving deep into the world of Java, sprinkling in some mySQL knowledge, and exploring the mysteries of DevOps. You could say I'm a coder by day, tennis enthusiast by afternoon, and an explorer by night.

##### **Projects in the Oven: From Code to Calculators and Photography Showcase**

Speaking of coding, I'm currently cooking up an [iOS calculator replica](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/ios-calculator) in Java. Why? Because why not? On a different wavelength, my [personal website](https://sebastian-sonne.github.io) is in the making. It's not just another showcase—it's a high-tech, high-art gallery for my photography. You know you're in the right place when even the pixels look picturesque.

##### **Open-minded Explorer Eager for Connections (and a Good Laugh)**

In a world full of algorithms, I'm just a guy looking for the perfect equation of fun and adventure. If you've got a joke to share, a tennis match to play, or a coding conundrum to crack, count me in. Let's make this online journey as exciting as the places I've been.

Feel free to [connect](https://sebastian-sonne.github.io/contact), share your own adventures, and maybe we'll swap a joke or two . After all, laughter is the best travel companion.

Cheers, Sebastian Sonne
