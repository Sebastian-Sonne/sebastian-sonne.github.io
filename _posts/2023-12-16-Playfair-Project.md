Welcome to the Playfair-Project, a Java application crafted to elevate students' programming proficiency. This innovative project not only serves as a platform to sharpen coding skills but also delves into the intriguing world of encryption. One of its highlights is the incorporation of the Playfair encryption method, providing a hands-on learning experience for students.

## Key Features

### Learn Encryption Basics

The Playfair-Project offers a practical avenue for students to grasp the fundamentals of encryption through the implementation of the Playfair technique. This hands-on learning experience empowers students to understand the intricacies of encryption algorithms, a crucial skill in today's digital landscape.

### User-Friendly IO System

Navigating the project is made seamless with a user-friendly Input/Output (IO) system. This system enhances the interaction with encryption and decryption processes, making it accessible and engaging for learners. Check out the UI outline [here](#).

### Input Error Detection

To cater to the unique requirements of the Playfair algorithm, the project features enhanced input error detection. This ensures a smooth and error-free execution of the encryption and decryption processes, contributing to a more effective learning experience.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to the Playfair-Project are highly encouraged. Whether you're a student eager to enhance existing features or an experienced developer with suggestions, your input is valuable. Consider contributing by translating the existing version into an English version of the program. Any questions you have will be promptly addressed.

## Disclaimer

**Note:** The Playfair encryption algorithm implemented in this project comes with inherent limitations. It is crucial to be aware of the following constraints:

- **Language Barrier:** The user interface, code comments, and descriptions in the "Verschluesselung" class are in German.

- **Character Restrictions:** Input and passwords are limited to alpha characters only, excluding the letter 'J' due to historical implementation reasons. Input Error Detection is in place for a smooth user experience.

- **Password Size Limitation:** For simplicity in this educational context, the password size is intentionally limited to 50 characters.

- **Input Error Detection:** The application includes customizable input error detection to suit specific requirements.

Users are encouraged to use this project for educational purposes, understanding that these limitations are specific characteristics of this implementation. The author disclaims any responsibility for the algorithm's use beyond its intended educational scope.
